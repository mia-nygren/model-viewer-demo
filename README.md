# 3D model-viewer Demo
This demo app is deployed at https://mia-nygren.github.io/model-viewer-demo/

## Development  
This project used [angular-sass-webpack boilerplate](https://github.com/thamsrang/angular7-sass-webpack4) as a starting point. 

**TypeScript**   
This project uses TypeScript for more predictable code, and to catch errors before they reach runtime. 

**model-viewer**  
This project uses &lt;model-viewer&gt; (a google web component) for displaying responsive and interactive 3D-models.

**Webpack**  
This project uses webpack, a module bundler as well as a task runner, for automating the development and building process.
